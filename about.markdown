I was a physics undergraduate, who had no choice but learn everything almost entirely by myself. Apart from physics, I also like programming. I appreciate and hate mathematics at the same time.

I like Unix and Vim.

I write primarily in `\LaTeX`. I also find markdown very easy to use.

C is powerful. Mathematica is awesome.

I learn, therefore I progress.
